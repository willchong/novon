Shipping:
[V] Amount of shipping cost keeps changing as the purchasing price keeps going up
- Fixed once box dimensions added
[V] The shipping has 4 options but it does not specify what company. Is it FedEx and Canada Mail
- Canada Post for sure
[V] Possibility of getting free basic shipping with certain amount of purchase – Let's say any purchase of $150 + (Canadian before tax)  gets free Standard Shipping. Let's discuss the consequence of shipping to the US or another country.

Pre Designed Bracelets
[V] Option to design your own should be removed because there is no such option (https://novoncollection.com/product-category/originals/pre-designed-bracelets/) – remove the design your own.

[ waiting on Rose Quartz ] There is no picture of Rose Quartz and Black Onyx rounds with 2 c-clasps in the assortment, they should be there.
[ v ]



[ waiting ] The picture of bracelet clasp is incomplete, there should be a picture that has both sides of the clasps in it
- Can a screenshot of this be sent? I'm unsure which bracelet we're talking about...


Stones
[ V ] The picture of Swarovski crystals should not have the little button on the other end 

[ v ] Az15F: Oval Amazonite has wrong picture


Coins
[ v ] Air, Water, Earth, Fire and Harmony Coins with double clasps have clasps in wrong location. The clasps should be arranged North-South (90 degrees from the current positioning)

[V] The Element coins should be displayed in order and not interrupted with any other piece

[ v ] In the config, the coins are still about 20% too large
[ v ]  The size of the c-clasp in relation to the coin is wrong – too small
